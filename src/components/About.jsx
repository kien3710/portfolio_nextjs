          Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer nearly 8 years ago,
          I ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups, and
          collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both
          business and consumer use. I m quietly confident, naturally curious,
          and perpetually working on improving my chopsone design problem at a
          time.
